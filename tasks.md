# Video Processing App Task List

## Overview
Create a video processing application where users can upload videos, which are then stored in Supabase blob storage. The app will process these videos into different resolutions using FFmpeg and serve them using HLS. The client will adaptively stream the video based on the client's network speed.

## Tasks

### 1. Setup and Configuration
- [x] Initialize a new Dash application.
- [ ] Set up Supabase for blob storage.
- [ ] Configure environment variables for Supabase and other services.

### 2. Video Upload
- [ ] Create a frontend component for video file upload.
- [ ] Implement backend logic to handle video uploads and store them in Supabase.

### 3. Video Processing
- [ ] Integrate FFmpeg to process uploaded videos into multiple resolutions (e.g., 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p).
- [ ] Store processed video files back in Supabase.

### 4. HLS Streaming
- [ ] Set up HLS streaming for processed videos.
- [ ] Implement logic to serve the appropriate video resolution based on client network speed.

### 5. Client-Side Adaptation
- [ ] Implement client-side logic to detect network speed.
- [ ] Adaptively switch video streams based on detected speed.

### 6. Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Test video upload and processing pipeline.
- [ ] Optimize video processing and streaming for performance.

### 7. Documentation
- [ ] Document the setup and usage of the application.
- [ ] Write a guide on how to extend the application with additional features.

### 8. Deployment
- [ ] Deploy the application to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, Vercel).
- [ ] Ensure all services are correctly configured and running.

## Additional Features (Optional)
- [ ] Implement user authentication for video uploads.
- [ ] Add analytics to track video views and performance.
- [ ] Enable video editing features (e.g., trimming, filters).
